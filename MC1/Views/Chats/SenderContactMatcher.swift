/// case-insensitive name matching against the local contact list.

    ///   - contacts: The contact list to filter, typically fetched from `PersistenceStore`.
    ///   - senderName: The sender display name from the channel message.
    ///   - excludeBlocked: When `true`, already-blocked contacts are omitted.
